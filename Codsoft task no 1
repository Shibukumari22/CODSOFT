Here is a solution in Java that follows the requirements for your number guessing game:

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberGuessingGame {

    // Method to play one round of the game
    public static void playRound(int maxAttempts, int rangeStart, int rangeEnd) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        int targetNumber = rand.nextInt(rangeEnd - rangeStart + 1) + rangeStart;
        int attempts = 0;
        boolean hasWon = false;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("I'm thinking of a number between " + rangeStart + " and " + rangeEnd + ". Can you guess it?");
        
        while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            int guess = scanner.nextInt();
            attempts++;

            if (guess == targetNumber) {
                hasWon = true;
                break;
            } else if (guess > targetNumber) {
                System.out.println("Too high!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Too low!");
            }

            System.out.println("Attempts remaining: " + (maxAttempts - attempts));
        }

        if (hasWon) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number in " + attempts + " attempts.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry! You've run out of attempts. The number was: " + targetNumber);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int totalScore = 0;  // Keeps track of the score across multiple rounds
        boolean playAgain = true;
        final int maxAttempts = 5;  // Maximum number of attempts for each round
        final int rangeStart = 1;   // Starting range of the number
        final int rangeEnd = 100;   // Ending range of the number

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");

        while (playAgain) {
            playRound(maxAttempts, rangeStart, rangeEnd);
            
            System.out.print("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ");
            String userResponse = scanner.next();
            playAgain = userResponse.equalsIgnoreCase("yes");

            if (playAgain) {
                totalScore++; // Increment score for each round played
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Thank you for playing! Your total score (rounds won) is: " + totalScore);
    }
}
